# Operating Systems – University Projects

This repository contains academic projects and lab exercises from the Operating Systems course.  
All programs were developed for **educational purposes** to demonstrate concepts such as signals, processes, threads, semaphores, and monitors.

⚠️ Note: The code was written and tested on **Linux (Ubuntu)** using GCC/Clang and POSIX libraries.  
It may not compile or run correctly on Windows without a POSIX compatibility layer (e.g., WSL or Cygwin).
